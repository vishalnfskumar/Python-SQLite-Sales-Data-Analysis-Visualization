## 📖 Overview  
This project is a **complete, self-contained workflow** for performing **sales data analysis** using **Python** and **SQLite**.  
It walks through the process of **creating a database**, **inserting sales data**, running **SQL queries**, and producing **visual reports** — making it an excellent reference for both **beginners** and **intermediate** learners in data analytics.  

Key steps include:  

- 📂 Creating `sales_data.db` if it doesn’t exist  
- 📊 Inserting **100 random sales records** (laptops, phones, tablets, accessories)  
- 🔍 Running SQL queries for **total sales, revenue, and monthly trends**  
- 🐼 Displaying results in **Pandas DataFrames**  
- 🎨 Visualizing results with **Matplotlib** (bar chart & line chart)  
- 💾 Saving charts as image files for reporting
